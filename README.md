# Angular Learning Project

This project is focused on applying all the learnings in angular using MongoDB, Express and Firebase Authentication for backend services.

# How will this project be structured?

Will be adding pages for every major section of angular
and in each one of them will assemble components that represent use cases of
angular concepts
