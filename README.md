# Angular Learning Project

This project is focused on applying all the learnings in angular using MongoDB, Express and Firebase Authentication for backend services.

# How will this project be structured?

Will be adding pages for every major section of angular
and in each one of them will assemble components that represent use cases of
angular concepts

#Installation instructions

run $npm install in the root folder and then in the server folder for Express web server dependencies.

#Why & How:
I used this project to practice the basics of angular and how to couple it with serverless Firebase and Express web server using REST endpoints. I will add graphql to this project in future as well. And some routing examples and how auth guard works.
Afterwards, i will focus on building web apps with user focus instead of this learning concepts app.
