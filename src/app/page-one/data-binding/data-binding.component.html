    <h3>How this page works bts</h3>
    <p>
      We use a service, accounts servive that was provided in the module of this
      page only. This service holds the data for accounts, adds new account and
      does status changes using a event emitter. <br />
      Account components with buttons on them change the status and thus their
      component file emit a status change. And another component listens to
      events emitted through subscribe method <br />
      previously we used event emitter in data binding where children components
      listened to events emitted of parents or vice versa. But that was handled
      thru the template. With services we dont have that restriction. we can use
      just a services and pass events and arguments among siblings as well.
